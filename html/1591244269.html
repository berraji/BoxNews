</figure><p class="story-body__introduction"> The South West has become the first region of England and Wales to see weekly deaths return to the range that would normally be expected, as the country continues to move beyond the worst weeks of the coronavirus pandemic. </p><p>In the latest figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the South West registered only 88 excess deaths in the week ending 22 May, compared to 807 excess deaths in the week ending 24 April. </p><p>Excess deaths refer to the number of registered deaths from all causes which are above the five-year average for that week of the year.</p><p>London, which was the epicentre of the pandemic in the UK, is also nearly back to normal levels. It recorded 215 excess deaths in the week ending 22 May (the ONS says nearly 90% mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate).</p><p>The week ending 17 April was the worst week in the capital, with over 2,200 excess deaths.</p><div aria-hidden="true" class="bbccom_slot mpu-ad" id="bbccom_mpu_1_2_3">

</figure><p>"These are the best figures available for the civilian deaths in the Blitz," said Richard Overy, professor of history at the University of Exeter.  </p><p>"This dramatic war on civilians has come to symbolise the horrors of total war, with the images of burning and ruined buildings and bodies dug out from the rubble." </p><p>"All the more poignant is the contrast with the current epidemic which killed considerably more people in 28 days in London's hospitals and care homes."</p><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Most deprived areas</h2><p>Separate ONS data released on 1 May shows that, once you take the age of population into account, the rate of deaths involving Covid-19 is roughly twice as high in the most deprived areas of England and Wales as in the least deprived.</p><p>"We know that people in more deprived areas are less likely to have jobs where they can work from home," said Helen Barnard from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.</p><p>"This means they may have to face a very significant drop in income or keep going to work, facing greater risks of catching virus. They are also more likely to live in overcrowded homes, increasing the risk for whole families."</p><p>The data shows that the highest rates of deaths involving Covid-19 are in inner-city areas where lots of people live close together.</p><p>The majority of the highest age-standardised mortality rates are in London boroughs, such as Newham, Brent and Hackney.</p><figure class="media-portrait no-caption full-width">
