People with mental health needs also face the stereotype of the mentally ill as 'mad, bad and dangerous'," says the review.</p><p>Inquest, a charity which focuses on police and prison deaths, said that because of this black people with mental health problems faced "double discrimination" by the police.</p><ul class="story-body__unordered-list"><li class="story-body__list-item"><a class="story-body__link" href="/news/uk-41804382">Custody deaths review urges shake-up</a></li></ul><p>It also suggested that investigations needed to explore whether discrimination played a factor in the deaths of black and minority ethnic (BAME) individuals more often. </p><p>The Angiolini report says that deaths in custody are part of a broader issue for minority groups. </p><p>"Deaths of people from BAME communities, in particular young black men, resonate with the black community's experience of systemic racism," it concludes.</p><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">The Lammy Review </h2><p>In 2017, the Lammy Review, conducted by Labour MP David Lammy, of <a class="story-body__link-external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/643001/lammy-review-final-report.pdf">the treatment of minority groups</a> in the criminal justice system said many in those communities found the system was "stacked against them".</p><p>It came almost 20 years after the <a class="story-body__link" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/285537.stm">review of the murder of black schoolboy Stephen Lawrence</a>, which concluded that the Metropolitan Police was "institutionally racist". </p><p>This inquiry led to the overhaul of the police disciplinary system, enhanced powers to inspect police forces and an internationally ground-breaking law that forced all public bodies to promote and improve racial equality. </p><p>Both reports highlight the disproportionate number of minorities - and in particular black people - at every level of the criminal justice system. </p><p>The most recent statistics from the Home Office and Ministry of Justice show: </p><ul class="story-body__unordered-list">
<li class="story-body__list-item">In 2018-19, black people were <a class="story-body__link-external" href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/crime-justice-and-the-law/policing/stop-and-search/latest">more than nine times as likely to be stopped and searched</a> by police as white people. </li>

</ul><p>Mr Lammy said at the time that while people from minority ethnic backgrounds were starting to break through many barriers, such as education, employment and representation, the "justice system bucks the trend".</p><p>"Those who are charged, tried and punished are still disproportionately likely to come from minority communities."</p><p>At the time,<a class="story-body__link-external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lammy-review-government-response"> the government acknowledged</a> Mr Lammy's "sober analysis of discrepancies in how people of different backgrounds experience the criminal justice system."</p><p>In response, the Government committed to publishing more data on race and ethnicity, including on the working of the courts, victims and offender management. It also established the Race and Ethnicity Board, which would monitor the implementation of recommendations made by the board. </p><figure class="media-landscape no-caption body-width">
