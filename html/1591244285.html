<li class="story-body__list-item">There is no data on how many of the tests posted out are then successfully completed</li>
<li class="story-body__list-item">It's not clear from the daily data how many people are tested more than once</li>
</ul><p>Some people are tested more than once - either to prove they no longer have Covid-19, or because a negative result appears incorrect given their symptoms, or because the first test doesn't work.</p><p>Sir David is also calling for more detailed data on those being tested. He wants age, sex, location and job to be included - such as working in a care home or hospital.</p><p>The government says it releases full data.</p><p>A spokesman said the government was working with statisticians and that the approach throughout had been to "increase transparency around the government's response to coronavirus".</p><ul class="story-body__unordered-list">
