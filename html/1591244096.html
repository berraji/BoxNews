This will allow the result, saying whether they tested positive or negative, to be delivered back to them via the app.</p><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Rival models</h2><p>Both the UK and France have created apps of their own based on a "centralised" design.</p><p>By contrast, Latvia, Italy and Switzerland have released apps based on a "decentralised" technology developed by Apple and Google.</p><p>Advocates of the centralised approach says it gives epidemiologists more data to analyse, helping them better target the contagion alerts. They are also not limited by rules imposed by the two tech companies, such as a ban on being able to gather location data. </p><p>Supporters of the decentralised model say it better protects users' anonymity and privacy.</p><figure class="media-portrait no-caption full-width">

</ul><p>Contact tracing apps are supposed to complement work done by humans quizzing those diagnosed with the disease. It remains unclear whether the limitations of relying on Bluetooth can be overcome to avoid capturing too many false flags.</p><p>Baroness Dido Harding, who heads up the government's Test and Trace programme, said little new about the app when she appeared before the House of Commons' Health and Social Care Committee, beyond saying it was a "high priority" to link it to medical test results.</p><p>But Prof Christophe Fraser, who advises the NHS on the project, told MPs there was a "need for speed". An app, he explained, could still be used to serve users amber warnings - perhaps advising them not to visit an elderly relative or a friend in a vulnerable group - while their contact awaited a result.</p><p>"The app provides the best early warning system by enabling us to record close physical contact with people we know, but also those we don't know or can't remember," the Oxford Big Data Institute academic told the BBC.</p><p>"Our latest analyses suggest that even at low levels of uptake, the app will have a protective effect across a localised network of contacts - if you, your friends, colleagues and family download the app, you're creating a local alert network within your community."</p><p>But it is still not clear whether other parts of the UK will adopt it.</p><p>Earlier, Northern Ireland's chief scientific advisor told the Stormont Health Committee that he planned to focus on manual contact tracing, saying he thought the app's usefulness had been overstated.</p><p>"At best, it is an adjunct," Prof Ian Young said. </p><p>The Health Minister Robin Swann added that he had concerns that the app would be unattractive to users because of concerns about it draining battery life, and that people at the end of a phone were already proving effective.</p>
