Facebook and YouTube both say they have cracked down on conspiracies that could do damage.</p><p>And in a high-profile move, Twitter decided to label a misleading tweet by US President Donald Trump - although it was one about postal voting rather than coronavirus. </p><p>But these changes in policy don't seem easy to implement. In practice, misleading posts are often not reported - or when they are, they are not always removed. The question of the harm different posts pose appears to be at the root of this problem. </p><p>Messages posing an immediate threat to life are removed more quickly. However, misleading messages that pose a less immediate threat can prove to be just as dangerous - including those from anti-vaccination groups. </p><p><a class="story-body__link" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-52731624">A BBC Investigation into the human cost of misinformation</a> found that the potential for indirect harm caused by conspiracies and bad information that undermine public health messaging - or an effective vaccine - could be huge. </p><p>And as misinformation about protests and other news events floods social media, it becomes apparent that the pandemic is just one of many battles against misinformation to be fought. </p>
