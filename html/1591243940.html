While HSBC moved its headquarters to London in 1993, Hong Kong is still its biggest market. </p><p>Standard Chartered also has a strong presence in Asia. "We believe the national security law can help maintain the long-term economic and social stability of Hong Kong," it said in a statement. </p><p>It added that "the 'one country, two systems' principle is core to the future success of Hong Kong and has always been the bedrock of the business community's confidence". </p><p><a class="story-body__link" href="/news/world-asia-china-52877411">Hong Kong's Tiananmen vigil banned for first time</a></p><ul class="story-body__unordered-list">

<li class="story-body__list-item">secession - breaking away from the country</li>
<li class="story-body__list-item">subversion - undermining the power or authority of the central government</li>
<li class="story-body__list-item">terrorism - using violence or intimidation against people</li>
<li class="story-body__list-item">activities by foreign forces that interfere in Hong Kong</li>
</ul><p>Hong Kong residents are concerned this will affect free speech and their right to protest. In China this would be seen as subversion. People are also worried about suggestions that China could set up its own institutions in Hong Kong responsible for security.</p><p>"The new national security law will deal the most severe blow to the rights of people in Hong Kong since the territory's transfer to China in 1997," according to Human Rights Watch.</p><p>HSBC had been previously caught up in Hong Kong's anti-government protests, with its branches vandalised and bronze lion statues outside its headquarters defaced during a protest march in January.</p><p>The bank is also facing its own challenges from the coronavirus pandemic with the prospect of thousands of job losses and a significant drop in earnings.</p><p>HSBC didn't respond to a request from the BBC for further comments about the social media post.</p>
