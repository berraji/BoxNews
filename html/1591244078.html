</figure><p>Cloudflare says that after Mr Floyd's death and the ensuing violent clashes between police and protesters, it saw a noticeable jump in the amount of requests it blocked - an extra 19 billion (17%) from the corresponding weekend the previous month.</p><p>That equates to an extra 110,000 blocked requests every second, it said.</p><p>The problem was particularly acute for certain types of organisations. One single website belonging to an unnamed advocacy group dealt with 20,000 requests a second.</p><p>Anti-racism groups which belong to Cloudflare's free programme for at-risk organisations saw a large surge in the past week, from near-zero to more than 120 million blocked requests.</p><figure class="media-landscape no-caption full-width">
