Many new graduates are not getting any industry face-time. </p><p>Racheal Owens, a teacher at Guildford School of Acting, says their graduates were due to have a final day of performance for agents and casting directors back in March. But a day before the show, the lockdown restrictions were announced, and it was cancelled. </p><p>"Some students had signed, but others had not, and would have been hoping for more opportunities, as we had two musicals left to perform,"she says. </p><p>The staff at Guilford have continued to do everything possible to get self tapes to agents. Luckily the industry in London has been receptive, in an effort to support this year's graduates, but there is very little work available.</p><p>"I really feel for these students, whose introduction to the industry is so compromised," says Ms Owens.</p><figure class="media-landscape has-caption full-width">

</figure><p>Alex Butler, who runs the New York boutique agency Henderson Hogan, warns his recent signings that things aren't going to get better overnight. </p><p>"I told them, 'Look, if you are in this for the long haul, come to the city, get your apartment, your day job and your classes set up. Once things go back, we can gear up.'"</p><p>But it could be a long wait. Mr Butler says he would love for Broadway to reopen in September but fears curtains may not rise until next year. </p><p>Still, he thinks that sometime down the road, if young actors coming out of school this year can hold tight, there will be opportunities to audition for these shows. </p><p>"People working on Broadway might decide they are done with the business, or if they are touring, their spouses won't want them to go on the road anymore," he says. </p><p>New York casting director Alison Franck, who casts Broadway, touring and regional musical theatre shows, says that actors have always needed to be creative and resilient. Those attributes are needed now more than ever, because many will struggle to get agents straight away.</p><figure class="media-landscape has-caption full-width">
