</ul><p>Sweden did ban visits to care homes on 31 March. But as in many European countries, relatives, staff and union officials have shared concerns that protective clothing arrived too late, and that some staff may have gone to work at the start of the crisis despite showing symptoms of Covid-19.</p><p>Now, increasing numbers of workers are also coming forward to criticise regional healthcare authorities for protocols which they say discourage care home workers from sending residents into hospital, and prevent care home and nursing staff from administering oxygen without a doctor's approval, either as part of acute or palliative (end-of-life) services.</p><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">'We were told not to send them in'</h2><p>"They told us that we shouldn't send anyone to the hospital, even if they may be 65 and have many years to live. We were told not to send them in," says Latifa Löfvenberg, a nurse who worked in several care homes around Gävle, north of Stockholm, at the beginning of the pandemic.</p><p>"Some can have a lot of years left to live with loved ones, but they don't have the chance... because they never make it to the hospital," she says.

</figure><p>Ms Löfvenberg is now working on a Covid-19 ward in a major hospital in the Swedish capital, where she says the demographic of patients she's treating is further evidence that the elderly are being kept away. "We don't have many older people. It's a lot of younger people born in the 90s, 80s, 70s."</p><p>A paramedic working in Stockholm, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC she had not had a single call-out to an elderly care home connected to Covid-19, despite putting in overtime during the crisis.</p><p>Mikael Fjällid, a Swedish private consultant in anaesthetics and intensive care, says he believes "a lot of lives" could have been saved if more patients had been able to access hospital treatment, or if care home workers were given increased responsibilities to administer oxygen themselves, instead of waiting for specialist Covid-19 response teams or paramedics.</p><p>"If you need care and you can benefit [from] care, for example, or oxygen for a short time, you should have it. Like any other age group in the population," says Mr Fjällid, a right-wing critic of the centre-left led government.</p><p>"If you have more than 20% that survive without nothing, you could assume that also perhaps the same amount or the same proportion would have survived with supplemental oxygen." </p><figure class="media-with-caption">

</figure><p>In April 10,458 people died in Sweden, making it the country's deadliest month since 1993, when there was an outbreak of seasonal flu, state-funded Statistics Sweden reports.</p><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">National guidelines</h2><p>Decisions about healthcare staffing and resources are taken at a regional level in Sweden, although national guidelines suggest that elderly patients, whether in state or privately run care homes, should not automatically be taken to hospital for treatment.</p><p>Dr Thomas Linden, Chief Medical Officer at the National Board of Health and Welfare, says workers should "professionally weigh the potential benefits" against risk factors such as catching the virus in hospital and the "costs" of transporting patients, including the likelihood of disorientation and discomfort. </p><p>Healthcare workers are asked not to discriminate on age alone, he says, although biological age may be relevant in combination with other factors. </p><p>When it comes to providing palliative care, it is not mandatory to give patients oxygen, and Dr Linden admits "the opinions on the value of oxygen is divided between specialities and regions". </p><p>Gävleborg, the region where Latifa Löfvenberg worked at the start of the pandemic, says individual patients' needs are always put first and that nurses can call doctors to make assessments about the need for hospital care. </p><p>It is against the idea of care-home workers administering oxygen during palliative care, because it requires specialist training.</p><p>Christoffer Bernsköld, a spokesperson for geriatric care for Region Stockholm, insists there are enough resources to ensure patients in the capital get acute or palliative care, with a focus on "specialist homecare units" providing help in the first instance.</p><figure class="media-landscape has-caption full-width">

In some cases, entire care homes have been moved into hospitals. Many homes also keep emergency oxygen on site. </p><p>The Danish Nurses Association says that all patients in need of oxygen are currently sent to hospital.
